1) The "Assignment1" directory was made using the command: (mkdir Assignment1) while inside the cs131 directory.


2) You can find your current shell by using (echo $SHELL) or (echo $0).

/bin/bash (Output from echo $SHELL which shows the default shell) 
-bash (Output from echo $0 which shows the current running program)


2) To find my home directory path I used the echo ($HOME) command.

/mnt/scratch/SP24_CS131_Jyotika/briansp24 (Output from echo $HOME


3) My userid is 1225 and I am in group 78. I found out using the (id) command.

uid=1225(briansp24) gid=1225(briansp24) groups=1225(briansp24),78(S78)


4) I can cd into the directory because I still have execute permissions. I can still list files using ls and ls -l because I still have read permissions. But I cannot create files under it because I do not have write permissions.


6) The memory usage of the VM can be found using (free -m), -m displays the memory in mebibytes.

              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:          71367       32424       19890        3514       19053       33970
Swap:          4119           0        4119


9) /etc/os-release is where the os version info is kept.
